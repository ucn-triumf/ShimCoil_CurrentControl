# ShimCoil_CurrentControl

This repository was formerly named `current_control` and was imported from [J. Martin's repository](https://github.com/jmartin1454/current_control).

This repository defines a GUI to control the power supply and do measurements with a fluxgate to test coil winding direction. It is expected to run by sending serial commands to an arduino using the code found [here](https://github.com/ucn-triumf/ShimCoil_SerialArduino).
