# Coil constants measured on March 6
# Columns:
#       coil: coil id
#       slope: V/nT conversion from field to
#       offset: V   voltage offset
#       dslope, doffset: errors in the above, same units
# Settings:
#       10 Hz LPF
#       Gain 50
#       With SCU1 rezeroed
#       +ve slope = field inward
#       Mag13-MS100 fluxgate
