These results generated by `test_channel_response.py`.

* We use the scope mean/stdev measure functions over a 5 second window to find the output of a given channel.
* All these measurements taken with the same resistor, measured to be 1.5 ohms with multimeter when disconnected from the amp.
* We measure the voltages in a random order, 20 evenly spaced points between -10V and 10V

We see the following:

* [coil 0](coil0.pdf)
* [coil 1](coil1.pdf)
* [coil 2](coil2.pdf)
* [coil 17](coil17.pdf)

In all cases it seems that the voltages measured across the resistor are

* decreasing with increasing voltage
* have non-linearly varying noises
* are slightly non-linear in and of themselves, especially near the endpoints
* have a large offset at 0V.
