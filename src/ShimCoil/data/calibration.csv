# Calibration values for shim coils
# Derek Fujimoto
# Feb 2025
#
# coil:    label of coils in the range [0, 63]
# cs:      chip select, one of (7, 8, 9, 10)
# ch:      channel on chip, in the range [0, 15]
# slope:   convert requested current to voltage in volts/amp
# offset:  voltage offset when converting requested current to volts, in volts
#
# The arduino expects us to set a voltage. Thus when a current is requested we
# do the following to calculate the voltage sent:
#
# voltage = current * slope + offset
#
# default slope is 1/(40mA/10V) = 250 V/A
