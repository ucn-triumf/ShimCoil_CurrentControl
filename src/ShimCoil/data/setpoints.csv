# Last set currents and voltages values for shim coils

#
# coil:    label of coils in the range [0, 63]
# voltage: in volts, possibly calculated from slope and offset in calibration file
# current: expected current in amps (note that the actual set quantity is the voltage)
# field:   expected field in nT (note that the actual set quantity is the voltage)
# setby:   which column we used to set the output voltage
#
# The arduino expects us to set a voltage. Thus when a current is requested we
# do the following to calculate the voltage sent:
#
# voltage = current * slope + offset
#
# default slope is 1/(40mA/10V) = 250 V/A
#
# if we set a voltage, we then calculate the expected current and save that
